# Useful_scripts_Python
This project includes several practical Python scripts, avoiding writing them from scratch.

## Intention
During my daily life, I find it rather bothering to write some simple scripts from scratch. Maybe it won't take too long, but sometimes turns out to be tiring. For this reason, I create this little project to collect the most useful scripts, helping others as well as me better accelerate our work.

## Contents
1. **dir_cmp.py**: compare all the files inside two directories and tell whether they are exactly the same.
